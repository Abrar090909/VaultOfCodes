Menu Display (display_menu function):

This function prints out the options available to the user for temperature conversion. Conversion Functions:

Each conversion function takes a temperature value and converts it to another unit based on the formulas for temperature conversion. Main Program (main function):

The main function is where the program execution begins. It uses a while loop to repeatedly display the menu and prompt the user for input until the user chooses to exit (choice == '7'). Depending on the user's choice (choice), it calls the appropriate conversion function and prints the result. Input Handling:

Each conversion option (1 through 6) prompts the user to enter a temperature value in the current unit. It then calls the corresponding conversion function and displays the result formatted with appropriate units. Exit Option:

If the user chooses 7, the program prints a goodbye message and breaks out of the loop, ending the program.# VaultOfCodes
